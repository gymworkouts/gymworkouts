<p>Im not really sure what pump youre getting from Adderall but the mind muscle connection is great on it. The safest thing to do would be to have a coffee if you must have caffeine and a stimulant free pre workout. I ve heard of doctors telling women that its. I would advice not taking it at all but if you do be sure to watch your heart rate. If youre truly ADHD try something thats nonnarcotic or at the very least use Ritalin since its somewhat safer. Adderall is pharmaceutical-grade crystal meth. Is Exercising Or Working Out On Adderall Safe Pbi.</p>
